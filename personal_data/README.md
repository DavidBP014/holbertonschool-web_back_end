Personal data
Description
What you should learn from this project:

0. Regex-ing
Write a function called filter_datum that returns the log message obfuscated:
1. Log formatter
Copy the following code into filtered_logger.py.
2. Create logger
Use user_data.csv for this task
3. Connect to secure database
Database credentials should NEVER be stored in code or checked into version control. One secure option is to store them as environment variable on the application server.
4. Read and filter data
Implement a main function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
5. Encrypting passwords
User passwords should NEVER be stored in plain text in a database.
6. Check valid password
Implement an is_valid function that expects 2 arguments and returns a boolean.
